\section{Material and Methods}

\section{Results}

To compare performance of newest version of R package pcadapt (v4.1.0) with previously published versions 2 and 3 (we use v3.0.4 here), we use public data of 4342 domestic dogs genotyped at 144,474 variants after quality control \cite[]{hayward2016complex}.
Previous versions of R package pcadapt used to compute the eigen decomposition of the Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM). 
Deriving PCs for this data takes 2111 seconds with pcadapt v3.0.4. Most of the time is taken to compute the GRM, therefore this timing is independent of the number of PCs computed.
With pcadapt v4.1.0, it takes 35, 60 and 102 seconds to compute K=5, 10 and 20 PCs, respectively. This represents a 60, 35 and 20 folds improvement in computation time.
