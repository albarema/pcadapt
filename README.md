**pcadapt** has been developed to detect genetic markers involved in biological adaptation. **pcadapt** provides statistical tools for outlier detection based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

To run the package, you can install it from CRAN:

```
install.packages("pcadapt")
library(pcadapt)
```

A tutorial for **pcadapt** is available. To access to the vignette, type the following command in your `R` console:

```
browseVignettes("pcadapt")
```

If you desire to install from GitHub, run the following commands:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BioShock38/pcadapt")
```
